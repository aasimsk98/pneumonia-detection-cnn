# Pneumonia Detection CNN with Streamlit
### **[► View Live App Here](https://pneumonia-detection-cnn.streamlit.app)**
---

This project is a complete, end-to-end demonstration of building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify chest X-ray images as "Normal" or "Pneumonia."

The final trained model is deployed in an interactive web application built with Streamlit.

**This project achieved a 90.22% accuracy and a critical 94% recall on the unseen test set.**

## Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow & Keras
* Streamlit
* Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)
* Pandas (for displaying metrics)
* Matplotlib (for plotting training history)

---

## Repository Structure

* `app.py`: The main Streamlit web application.
* `train.py`: The script to train the CNN from scratch using augmentation and callbacks.
* `evaluate.py`: The script to evaluate the final model and generate the report.
* `pneumonia_model.h5`: The final, trained, and saved Keras model file.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of all Python libraries required to run the project.
* `.gitignore`: Tells Git to ignore specific files and folders (like the `chest_xray/` dataset).
* `.gitattributes`: Tells Git to use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for the large `.h5` model file.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Final Model Performance (90.22% Accuracy)

These results were generated by `evaluate.py` on the test set of 624 images, which the model had never seen during training.

### Classification Report

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **NORMAL** | 0.89 | 0.85 | 0.87 |
| **PNEUMONIA** | 0.91 | 0.94 | 0.92 |

### Confusion Matrix

| | Predicted: NORMAL | Predicted: PNEUMONIA |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **True: NORMAL** | 198 | 36 |
| **True: PNEUMONIA**| 25 | 365 |

## How to Run This Project

### 1. Prerequisites (Git LFS)

This repository uses **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** to handle the large `pneumonia_model.h5` model file. You must have Git LFS installed to clone this repository correctly.

1.  [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  [Install Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
3.  Run `git lfs install` once to set it up.

### 2. Get the Code & Model

When you clone this repository, Git LFS will automatically download the large model file.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/aasimsk98/Pneumonia-Detection.git
cd Pneumonia-Detection
```
### 3. Get the Data
This project does not include the data due to its large size. You must download the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset from Kaggle.

**Download Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

**Setup:** After downloading, extract the chest_xray folder so that it is in the root of this project directory (i.e., Pneumonia-Detection/chest_xray/). The .gitignore file will prevent this folder from being accidentally uploaded.

### 4. Set Up Your Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all necessary libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Streamlit Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py # Your browser will automatically open to the application.
```
